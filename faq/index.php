        FAQ
    </div><br/>

    <div id="question">
        How can you tell the difference between a child who is just taking his or her time and one who has a true developmental delay?</div>
    <div id="answer">Developmental delay is when a child does not reach a milestone by the upper range of healthy. Even though babies develop at their own pace, he explains, "every child should do certain tasks by a certain age.‚Äù</div>
    <div id="answer">A child can stray from the timeline and still be within the range of healthy, but it's best to discuss any concerns with your pediatrician</div>
    <br/><div class="line"></div><br/>

    
    <div id="question">
        Why hasn't my child reached a certain milestone yet?</div>

    <div id="subquest">Have you given them a chance?</div>
    <div id="answer">"Often there's not even a delay. Sometimes a parent just isn't giving the child opportunities. For example, a baby may not sit alone because he's always being held, rather than having time on the floor."</div>

    <div id="subquest">Was your child born premature?</div>
    <div id="answer">"Children who are premature may not have the same rate of muscle strength and development,"</div>

    <div id="subquest">Speech/comprehension related?</div>
    <div id="answer">Likely culprit is hearing loss due to recurrent ear infections</div>
    <div id="subquest">A less common cause is autism, particularly if the child also has difficult interacting socially</div>

    <div id="subquest">Significant delay?</div>
    <div id="answer">Genetic disorders such as down syndrome and developmental disabilities such as cerebral palsy or mental retardation.</div>

<div id="question">
        If I think something is wrong, who should I contact?</div>
    <div id="answer">For all questions and concerns, reach out to your child's pediatrician.</div><br/>
    <br/><div class="line"></div><br/>

<div id="question">
        How can I see my child's growth compared to the national average?</div>
    <div id="answer">There is a toggle switch above each growth graph that will allow you to turn the national average chart on or off.</div>
    <br/><div class="line"></div><br/>

<div id="question">
        Does Child Check use the CDC's growth charts?</div>
    <div id="answer">Yes.</div>
