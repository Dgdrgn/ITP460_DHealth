        FAQ

    <div id="question">
        How can you tell the difference between a child who is just taking his or her time and one who has a true developmental delay?</div>
    <div id="answer">Developmental delay is when a child does not reach a milestone by the upper range of what is considered healthy. Even though babies develop at their own pace, every child should do certain tasks by a certain age. A child can stray from the timeline and still be within the range of healthy development, but it's best to discuss any concerns with your child's pediatrician</div>
    <br/><div class="line"></div><br/>

    
    <div id="question">
        Why hasn't my child reached a certain milestone yet?</div>
    <div id="subquest">Have you given them a chance?</div>
    <div id="answer">"Often there's not even a delay. Sometimes a parent just isn't given the child an opportunity. For example, a baby may not sit on his own because he's always being held, rather than having time on the floor."</div>

    <div id="subquest">Was your child born premature?</div>
    <div id="answer">"Children who are premature may not have the same rate of muscle strength and development, so keep this is mind when you're evaluating his or her progress.</div>

    <div id="subquest">Is the delay speech or comprehension related?</div>
    <div id="answer">If so, likely culprit is hearing loss due to recurrent ear infections.  A less common cause is autism, particularly if the child also has difficultly interacting socially</div>

    <div id="question">How common are significant delays?</div>
    <div id="answer"> Significant developmental delays affect approximately 2% of US children.</div>

    <div id="question">If my child is experiencing a delay, what can be done to help get them back on track?</div>
    <div id="answer"> There are a range of options when it comes to helping your child progress in a healthy way.  Some include occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, and special education programs.</div>

<div id="question">
        If I think something is wrong, who should I contact?</div>
    <div id="answer">For all questions and concerns, reach out to your child's pediatrician.</div><br/>
    <br/><div class="line"></div><br/>

<div id="question">
        How can I see my child's growth compared to the national average?</div>
    <div id="answer">There is a toggle switch above each growth graph that will allow you to turn the national average chart on or off.</div>
    <br/><div class="line"></div><br/>

<div id="question">
        Does Child Check use the CDC's growth charts?</div>
    <div id="answer">Yes.</div>
