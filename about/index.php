    <div id="about">
        Child Check is a joint venture brought to you by the <a href="http://dhealth.usc.edu">D-Health Lab</a> at USC. Pairing tech students with representatives from USC’s Keck School of Medicine and the Children’s Hospital LA, D-Health sought to make a simple application to help parents track their children’s early growth and developmental milestones. This app focuses on both the quantitative – like height and weight – and qualitative – like first steps and sitting upright – measures of early child developmental success. Its primary goal is to give parents access to their child’s growth data in an easily readable and functional desktop application, all from the comfort of their home.
